# Obstacle Course

**Dodge all obstacles and reach the end with the least number of hits**

The controls:
1. The PC version of the game can be played using the Keyboard OR a Gamepad. Gamepad is recommended because a Keyboard input is binary while a gamepad input is a float value which can give more control over the character
2. The Android version(s) have its own stick controls that mimic the gamepad.

## VERSIONS
*Version 1: Basic prototype. Just to get the hang of movement using the new input system*
*Version 2: Added obstacles that change colour when collided with by the player.*
*Version 1: Added a lot of obstacles, triggers for various events and optimised the visuals for low end devices.*

### Key Features
1. The game is made using URP (Universal Render pipeline). 
2. Used a lot of prefabs to make the level-design easier
3. A counter to count the number of obstacles collided with
4. Added a Cinemachine Follow Camera that frame the action properly.
5. Added many Post-Processing effects like ACES lighting, Tonemapping and Motion Blur
